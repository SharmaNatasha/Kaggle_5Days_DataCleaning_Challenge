(Can you believe it's already been five days??) Today, we're going to learn how to clean up inconsistent text entries. To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n\n> **Your turn!** As we work through this notebook, you'll see some notebook cells (a block of either code or text) that has \"Your Turn!\" written in it. These are exercises for you to do to help cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to answer a specific question, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac). You can also click in a cell and then click on the right \"play\" arrow to the left of the code. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n\nHere's what we're going to do today:\n\n* [Get our environment set up](#Get-our-environment-set-up)\n* [Do some preliminary text pre-processing](#Do-some-preliminary-text-pre-processing)\n* [Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry](#Use-fuzzy-matching-to-correct-inconsistent-data-entry)\n\n\nLet's get started!"

(I [looked it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_populous_cities_in_Pakistan) and 'd.g khan' is a seperate city, so I shouldn't combine those.) \n\nI'm going to use the [fuzzywuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) package to help identify which string are closest to each other. This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn't scale well. (Would you want to correct a thousand errors by hand? What about ten thousand? Automating things as early as possible is generally a good idea. Plus, it’s fun! :)\n\n> **Fuzzy matching:** The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings. Here, we're going to get the ten strings from our list of cities that have the closest distance to \"d.i khan\"."
